About Guard Uncle is a DIY IoT security camera that solves false alarms. Using an ESP32-CAM, it captures an image on motion, sends it to an AI for analysis, and delivers the photo with object tags (e.g., "person") to your phone via Telegram. Get smart, verifiable alerts instead of vague notifications, so you know what's actually happening.
